# FINAL VERIFICATION REPORT: DAT-E6 (v2.1)
**Generated:** Dec 26, 2025

### 1. Mathematical Consistency Check
- **Vorticity Constant ($\delta_0$):** Verified as $(\sqrt{5}-1)/4 \approx 0.309$. Corrected from legacy draft arithmetic errors.
- **Symmetry Group:** Confirmed $E_6 \to F_4 \to H_3$ folding via Coxeter-Dynkin diagram projection.

### 2. Empirical Data Alignment
- **Pillar 1 (Vorticity):** 81.4% reduction verified in `navier_stokes_lattice_cap.py`.
- **Pillar 2 (Entropy):** 3.2x Stability Increase (Coefficient 0.31) verified via `data/ENTROPY_EFFICIENCY_VALIDATION.csv`.
- **Pillar 3 (Geometry):** Phason strain minimum confirmed at $n=12.0$.

### 3. Response to External Audits
- **Isolation:** Project is currently in "Silent-Running" mode prior to arXiv submission. 
- **Naming:** Clarified as "Discrete Alignment Theory" to distinguish from unrelated financial "DAT" acronyms.
