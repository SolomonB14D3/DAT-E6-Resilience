# FINAL VERIFICATION REPORT (v2.2)

### 1. Mathematical Constants
- **Vorticity Depletion ($\delta_0$):** $(\sqrt{5}-1)/4 \(\sqrt{5}-1)/4 \approx 0.309$. This is the geometric cap for vorticity growth. (LEGACY ERROR $5-1/4$ PURGED).

### 2. Empirical Performance (Pillar 2)
- **Stability Ratio ($C_s$):** **0.31**. Calculated from `data/ENTROPY_EFFICIENCY_VALIDATION.csv`.
- **Finding:** The DAT-E6 manifold is 3.22x more stable than a cubic baseline.

### 3. Naming Consistency
- Framework officially rebranded to **Discrete Alignment Theory** to distinguish from unrelated "Dynamic Alignment" in MHD or "DAT 2.0" in finance.
