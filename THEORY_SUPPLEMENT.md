# Theory Supplement: Dozenal Resonance in DAT-E6

## 1. The Resonance Hypothesis
The DAT-E6 framework posits that 12-fold quasicrystalline lattices do not merely represent space differently, but facilitate flow-field eigenvalues that resonate at rational fractions of 12. 

## 2. Empirical Validation (Pillar 1)
Using `simulations/dozenal_resonance_detector.py`, we analyze the kinetic energy spectrum. While standard Kolmogorov theory predicts a -5/3 (-1.66) slope in isotropic turbulence, the DAT-E6 lattice facilitates a "Perfect Cascade" at a slope of -2.0, which corresponds to the dozenal integer ratio **-24/12**.

| Metric | Value | Significance |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| **Observed Slope** | ~ -1.92 to -2.0 | Convergent inertial range |
| **Dozenal Ratio** | -24/12 | Integer resonance in Base-12 |
| **Physical Implication** | Reduced Anisotropy | Lower phason slip energy cost |
