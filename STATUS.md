# DAT Project Status
**Version:** 3.0 (Revised)
**Last Updated:** January 2026

## Current Status

The Navier-Stokes regularity claims have been **withdrawn**. What remains is a computational quasicrystal framework.

## Validated
- **E₆ → H₃ projection**: Correct Coxeter group theory (known mathematics)
- **Quasicrystal generation**: Cut-and-project implementation works correctly
- **Phonon localization**: 4.2× IPR contrast vs cubic (consistent with literature)
- **Phason dynamics**: Bond reconfiguration under perpendicular-space shifts

## Withdrawn
- ~~Vorticity Capping: 81.4% reduction~~ — solver artifact (integrating factor inherently stable)
- ~~NS regularity via δ₀~~ — bounded depletion cannot change Z^(3/2) exponent
- ~~Universal δ₀ across Millennium Problems~~ — connections falsified or insufficient

## Corrective Actions
- [x] Fixed legacy δ₀ arithmetic
- [x] Rebranded naming
- [x] Removed placeholder DOI links
- [x] **Withdrew NS regularity claims** (January 2026)
- [x] **Updated all documentation to reflect revised status**
