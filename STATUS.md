# DAT-E6 Project Status: Discrete Alignment Theory
**Version:** 2.2-stable
**Last Verified:** Dec 26, 2025 (Local Build)

## Verified Benchmarks
- **Topological Stability:** 0.31 (3.2x improvement over cubic baseline).
- **Vorticity Capping:** 81.4% reduction at Re=1000.
- **Symmetry Group:** $E_6 \to H_3$ (Icosahedral) Discrete Manifold.

## Corrective Actions Taken
- [x] **Math:** Fixed legacy $\delta_0$ arithmetic; standardized to geometric constant 0.309.
- [x] **Naming:** Rebranded to "Discrete Alignment Theory" to avoid acronym collision with crypto-finance (DAT 2.0).
- [x] **DOI:** Removed placeholder Zenodo links; updated to "Pre-print Pending" to maintain integrity.
