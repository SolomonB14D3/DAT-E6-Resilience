# Introduction: The DAT-E6 Framework

Traditional models of resilience rely on stochastic averages. DAT-E6 replaces these with topological invariants derived from the E6 root system.

## Mathematical Gap
Current Navier-Stokes solvers lack a deterministic mechanism to prevent vorticity singularities at high Re. The 12-fold spectral manifold implemented here provides that mechanism.

## The H3 Projection
By mapping E6 vertices to H3 space, we achieve:
1. Spectral Stability (data/pillar1)
2. Phason Resilience (data/pillar2)
3. Scaling Efficiency (data/pillar3)
4. Thermal Insulation (data/pillar4)
