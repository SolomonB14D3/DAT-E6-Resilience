# Methods: The DAT-E6 Projection Framework

## E6 to H3 Folding
We utilize a unitary projection matrix defined by the golden ratio to map 6D root systems to 3D. This code is centralized in `dat_core.py`.

## Validation Metrics
1. **Phason Strain**: Monitored via the perpendicular space displacement of projected vertices.
2. **Thermal Localization**: Simulated using a 12-fold interference potential on the H3 manifold.
3. **Spectral Regulation**: Enforced via the 12-fold regulator used in Pillar 1 fluid simulations.
